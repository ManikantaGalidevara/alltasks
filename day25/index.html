    <h2>Java Script History</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape. It was initially developed in just 10 days and was called Mocha, later renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. JavaScript quickly became essential for web development due to its ability to add interactivity to websites. In 1996, Microsoft introduced JScript as a rival. The language was standardized by ECMA in 1997, leading to the ECMAScript specification. Over time, it evolved with major updates like ES5 (2009) and ES6 (2015), making it powerful and widely used across web, mobile, and server environments.</p>
    <h2>What is JS</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and functionality to web pages. It enables developers to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and manage page behaviors. JS runs in browsers, making it crucial for front-end development. It’s event-driven and can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to update web pages without needing to reload. JavaScript has also expanded to server-side development through environments like Node.js, making it a versatile language across platforms.</p>
    <h2>Uses of JS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Web Development:</b> Enhances user interaction by manipulating HTML and CSS, creating dynamic web pages.</li>
    <li><b>Web Applications:</b> Powers frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue for building complex, interactive apps.</li>
    <li><b>Server-Side Development:</b>Using Node.js, JS handles server tasks, APIs, and database interaction.</li>
    <li><b>Mobile App Development:</b>Helps in developing cross-platform mobile apps using frameworks like React Native.</li>
    <li><b>Game Development:</b>Enables creating browser-based games.</li>
    <li><b>Automation and Scripting:</b>Automates repetitive tasks or web-based activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JS and Ecmas script</h2>
    <p><b>JavaScript (JS)</b> is a programming language primarily used for building interactive web applications.</p>
    <p><b>ECMAScript (ES) </b>is the standard specification that defines the core features of JavaScript. ECMAScript provides the foundation for JS, with versions like ES5 (2009) and ES6 (2015) bringing new features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions.</p>
    <p>In essence, JavaScript implements ECMAScript standards, and the terms are often used interchangeably, though ECMAScript refers to the official specification behind the language.</p>
    <h2>What make JS Unique</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Client-Side Execution: </b>JS runs directly in the browser, allowing real-time interactivity without needing server requests.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamic Typing:</b>JS doesn’t require predefined variable types, making it flexible and easy to use.</li>
        <li><b>Event-Driven:</b>JS responds to user inputs (clicks, scrolls, etc.) dynamically.</li>
        <li><b>Versatility:</b>JS can be used for both front-end (browser) and back-end (server with Node.js) development.</li>
        <li><b>Asynchronous Programming:</b>Supports promises, async/await, and callbacks for non-blocking operations.</li>
    </ul>
